# Payment

We process orders against prepayment only. We currently offer the following payment options:

* **Cash payment**: directly and personally in our store, or anonymously by throwing an envelope in a designated mailbox in our store
* **Cash letter**, e. g. as a [Deutsche Post Einschreiben Wert](https://www.deutschepost.de/de/e/einschreiben/kuendigung-abo-themen/geld-verschicken.html) (up to 100 €), as a [DHL parcel](https://www.dhl.de/content/dam/images/pdf/dhl-wertgegenstaende-de.pdf) (up to 500 € per day) or by a contracted cash and valuable transport. Please note the respective terms and conditions, especially the maximum limits, in order not to lose the insurance coverage of the shipping service provider. You can place banknotes in a neutrally packed book, for example, which we will return to you together with the ordered goods.
* **Cryptocurrencies**: [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) (XMR) and [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) (BTC)
* **SEPA bank transfer** to our bank account. Note the metadata involved in this process.
* **Cash deposit at a bank** to our bank account. The availability of this option and the amount of the fees differ from bank to bank and sometimes even between bank employees.
